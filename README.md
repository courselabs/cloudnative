The practical work is adapted from two other sets of labs:

- [Docker](https://docker.courselabs.co) - https://github.com/courselabs/docker
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.courselabs.co) - https://github.com/courselabs/kubernetes

The Sock Shop microservices demo application is from the Weaveworks & Container Solutions demo app:

- [Microservices demo app](https://microservices-demo.github.io)
- [Application repos on GitHub](https://github.com/microservices-demo) - contain all the source code
- [Deployment repo](https://github.com/microservices-demo/microservices-demo) - contains deployment manifests
